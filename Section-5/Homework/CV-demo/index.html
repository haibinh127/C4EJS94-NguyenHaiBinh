            <h1>Work Experience</h1>
            <h4>2016 - 2017</h4>
            <h4>My favourite</h4>

            I was taken by my brother to take pictures and since then I have really liked it

            <h4>2017 - 2018</h4>
            <h4>Practice </h4>

            I practiced and learned how to hold the camera, how to adjust the settings to get a good shot

            <h4>2018 - present</h4>
            <h4>Work</h4>

            I am currently working at a student yearbook studio and used to work for 1900
